# When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
# than keeping all your work local?

If you are collaborating or working from different
locations it helps to have a remote repo.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
# rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
# with your remote repository?

If many people are working on the same repository then
pulling might bring in changes that you aren't prepared for.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
# When would you use one instead of another?

-Forks will create a clone on github and have a reference back
to the original repository.
-Clones will create a clone locally or on github and will not
have a reference to the repository that it is cloned from
-Branches remain in a single repository and separates coding
efforts from the master branch

# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last
# known state of the remote stored locally?

This enables you to compare the remote version against
your local version changes.
 
# How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
# What would be easier, and what would be harder?

To collaborate without git or github would require multiple users
making changes to the same version of code. It would be easier to
change the code which could also be a bad thing. Tracking of 
changes would be impossible for large teams.
