# What happens when you initialize a repository? 
# Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository git will create 
the necessary directories for the metadata. 
The metadata is used to track file attributes such 
as version, commit ID, repository, commit comments...

# How is the staging area different from the working 
# directory and the repository?

The staging area is used by git to mark files as 
being tracked before commiting them to the repository.

# What value do you think it offers?

This allows you to commit some of the files rather 
than all of the files in the directory.

# What are some situations when branches would be 
# helpful in keeping your history organized?
# How would branches help?

Some useful situations for creating branches would be
the following:
-making an experimental branch to test new features without
 modifying the stable, or master branch. The changes may or
 may not be merged back into the master branch.
-making  new versions of the code which will remain seperate
