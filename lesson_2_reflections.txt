# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository git will create the necessary directories for the metadata. The metadata is used to track file attributes such as version, commit ID, repository, commit comments...

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
The staging area is used by git to mark files as being tracked before commiting them to the repository.

# What value do you think it offers?
This allows you to commit some of the files rather than all of the files in the directory.
